            <h2>What is ox bone soup, also known as Seolleongtang?</h2>
                <p>Seolleongtang is a traditional Korean soup that is created using a broth borne from the bones of a oxen tail. 
                    It has a rich flavor profile and the flavor only grows deeper the longer you cook the broth. It has been a staple 
                    since ancient times and is a favorite among many koreans, particulary after a night of drinking, as it is also known as 
                    the hang over soup in Korea.

                <h3>How to make ox bone soup</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Soak the ox bones and the beef in cold water for 20 minutes to remove any blood.</li>
                        <li>Rinse bones in cold water a couple of times to remove any bone chips. Drain the water.</li>
                        <li>Boil 14 cups water (3½ quarts) in a large pot</li>
                        <li>Put the bones and beef into the pot of boiling water. Boil for about 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Turn off the heat and take out the bones and beef. Get rid of the water.</li>
                        <li>Rinse and drain the meat in cold water to remove the excess fat.</li>
                        <li>Put the bones and the beef back into the pot</li>
                        <li>Add about 12 cups of water (3 quarts), 1 medium size onion, and 1½ pounds of peeled radish to the pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
                        <li>When it starts boiling about 20-30 minutes later, lower the heat to simmer for 3 hours.</li>
                        <li>Turn off the heat and take the beef and radish out of the pot. Leave the bones behind.</li>
                        <li>Put the beef and radish into a bowl.</li>
                        <li>Pour the brownish broth out of the pot and into a large bowl. We’re going to keep boiling these bones and collect the broth into this collecting bowl as we go along. Keep it in the fridge during this process.</li>
                        <li>Fill the pot with water again (about 3 quarts) and boil over medium high heat for about 20 minutes. When it starts boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 2½ to 3 hours.</li>
                        <li>Turn off the heat, open the lid, and pour the broth into the collecting bowl. It will be a lot whiter than the first time we poured it out.</li>
                        <li>Fill your pot with water again and boil over medium high heat for about 20 minutes. When it starts boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 2½ to 3 hours.</li>
                        <li>Turn off the heat, open the lid, and pour the broth into the collecting bowl. This time it will be really white, but thin.</li>
                        <li>Cool down the collecting bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Keep it in the refrigerator for several hours until all the fat floats to the top and gets solid. This is going to be our bone soup.</li>
