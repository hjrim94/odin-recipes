<h2>What is bulgogi?</h2>
    <p>Bulgogi is the korean version of marinated beef. It is a sweet and savory dish that is best complimented by a steaming
        hot bowl of rice and some delicious kimchi. It is a staple of Korean cuisine and is beloved by many worldwide. It is marinated using 
        a combination of soy sauce, honey, sugar, pineapple, vinegar to create a sweet and savory marinade that also works
        to break down the meat during the marination process to make it tender and fall apart while chewing.

    <h3>How to make bulgogi</h3>

            <li>Place the thinly sliced meat in a mixing bowl and pour the marinade over it. Mix them well together while gently massaging the meat with your hands. (Wearing a food prep glove is very handy here!)</li>
