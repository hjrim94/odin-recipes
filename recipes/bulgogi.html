<h2>What is bulgogi?</h2>
    <p>Bulgogi is the korean version of marinated beef. It is a sweet and savory dish that is best complimented by a steaming
        hot bowl of rice and some delicious kimchi. It is a staple of Korean cuisine and is beloved by many worldwide. It is marinated using 
        a combination of soy sauce, honey, sugar, pineapple, vinegar to create a sweet and savory marinade that also works
        to break down the meat during the marination process to make it tender and fall apart while chewing.
